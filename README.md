# Project Overview 

This repository documents experiments conducted in the Unity game engine to evaluate the code generation capabilities of various large language models (LLMs). 
Each language model was selected based on current trends and assigned to create a separate game environment or "scene" by completing a sequence of 5 coding tasks.

Each model was presented with the same set of 5 progressive coding tasks
The generated code was implemented in separate Unity scenes
Results were documented and analyzed for performance, accuracy, and adaptability
Code samples were preserved in their own directories for comparison
